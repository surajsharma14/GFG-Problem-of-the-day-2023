/*N Students of different heights are attending an assembly. 
The heights of the students are represented by an array H[]. 
The problem is that if a student has less or equal height than the student standing in front of him, then he/she cannot see the assembly.
Find the minimum number of students to be removed such that maximum possible number of students can see the assembly.*/
